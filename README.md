repo contains both H1b and Venmo challenge

I have received 2 emails from Insight team that direct me to 2 different code challenges. I have emailed Insight team about this issue but I have not heard back from them yet. Since both challenges seem very interesting, I decide to attempt both. 
The H1b challenge is located in the /h1b_statistics-master/ directory. The venmo challenge is located in the /coding-challenge-master/ sub-directory. The directory structures inside either of the sub-directory are the same as the original. Since I submit both challenges, there will be a home directory in my github directory that contains both of my submissions. I sincerely hope that you still consider my application even such modification may violate your directory structure requirement.
